# Phase 1: Developer Setup

## Overview

Welcome to Phase 1 of the CISOtopia Bootcamp. In this phase, you'll set up a complete development environment and deploy your first containerized application to AWS.

## What You'll Learn

- Configure Wiz Cloud Connector
- Work with GitHub repositories
- Build and test applications locally with Docker
- Push container images to Amazon ECR
- Deploy applications to Amazon EKS

## Lab Environment

- **Developer Workstation**: Windows VM with pre-installed tools
  - Docker
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Chrome browser
  - Gulp build tools
- **Amazon RDS Database**: Pre-configured with seeded data
- **Amazon EKS Cluster**: Kubernetes cluster with Wiz sensor installed
- **Wiz Cloud Connector**: Security scanning and monitoring
- **IAM Permission Boundary**: AWS security controls

## Phase Steps

In this phase, you will:

1. **Configure the Wiz Connector** - Set up cloud security monitoring
2. **Upload Code to GitHub** - Create a public repository for your application
3. **Test Locally** - Build and test the application using Docker and Gulp
4. **Create ECR Repository** - Set up container image storage in AWS
5. **Prepare EKS Cluster** - Deploy Kubernetes infrastructure using CloudFormation
